# LearnAndroid
## About
- This repository contains a set of personally created tutorials for teaching basic Android Development concepts.
## Plans
- Extend and continue developing simple projects that are easy to follow.
- Write out empty exercise templates with guided TODOs for users to be able to complete on their own in order to learn.
- Provide an exercise and completed solution set for each concept lesson.
- Eventually link these small 'exercises' on my website and create extensive Android Development tutorials for beginners
## Status
- Work in Progress
